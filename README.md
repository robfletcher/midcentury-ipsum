A filler text generator built with [Ratpack](http://ratpack-framework.org/).

**Mid-Century Ipsum** is live at [midcentury-ipsum.herokuapp.com](http://midcentury-ipsum.herokuapp.com/).

Append a number to the URL to get that many paragraphs of text (the default is 4). You can also use an *Accept* header to get `text/plain` or `application/json` data instead of HTML.

Pull requests with additional text welcome – just edit [corpus.txt](https://github.com/robfletcher/midcentury-ipsum/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/energizedwork/midcenturyipsum/corpus.txt)!
